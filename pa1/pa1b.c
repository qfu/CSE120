/* Programming Assignment 1: Exercise B
 *
 * Now we will expand the program of Exercise A to call Fork () multiple times.
 * Run the program below and answer the following questions:
 *
 * 1. Can you explain the order of what gets printed based on the code?
 *
 * 2. Why does the first child execute before the second child?
 *
 * 3. Move the two print statements executed by the parent to just after
 * where it says HERE.  How can you print the pid of the first child?
 *
